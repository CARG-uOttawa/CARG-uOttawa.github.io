The CARG group focuses on data-driven solutions for critical challenges in biomedical, automotive, and surveillance applications. By combining physical models with uncertainty-aware machine learning models we create robust systems that have real-world impact. Our work draws on extensive field data from UAV (drone) detection and inspection, as well as patient data for wearable and contactless medical solutions.
Over 70 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows have contributed to our multidisciplinary research, driving innovation across healthcare and communications.
Areas of Focus:
<ul>
<li> Biomedical & Automotive Innovation </li>
We collaborate with medical and industry partners to design signal processing algorithms and machine learning models for patient monitoring and UAV-based inspection.
<li> Integrated Modeling & Simulation </li>
Our team focuses on modeling to better understand complex physical problems before deploying practical solutions.
<li> Computational Efficiency </li>
We harness hardware and software accelerators—including GPUs and FPGAs—to achieve real-time performance and scalability.
</ul>

It combines three subgroups:

<h3> Why we chose the name CARG </h3>
<ul>
<li> History: this research group evolved from Computer Architecture research group (original CARG). Computer architecture research group was formed in 2008 and focused on the following topics: computer architectures, signal processing architectures, hardware and software accelerators, GPU architectures and programming and algorithmic modifications for more efficient implementation in hardware.
In recent years our research has gone in several different directions and therefore we decided to change the name of our group to Computational Analysis and Acceleration Research Group (new CARG). </li>
<li> Computational analysis combines aspects of mathematical modeling, data processing, and algorithm development to produce insights that guide research and practical applications.</li>
<li> Acceleration refers to techniques and technologies used to increase the speed of data processing and computation. </li>
</ul>
