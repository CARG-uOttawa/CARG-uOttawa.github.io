CARG HUB serves a versatile space for both small-scale and large-scale initiatives, mainly based on different applications od machine learning and signal processing. From solo efforts involving a single student to collaborative projects with multiple students and industry partners, CARG HUB embodies the spirit of adaptability and interdisciplinary research.

Recently completed projects at CARG HUB:

1. [CARG HUB: AI for bioreactors](/hub/hub-1)
- Collaborators: NRC, Ottawa; McGill University, Montreal
- Status: Completed in 2023
- This project aimed to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict cell growth in bioreactors, helping optimize bioprocesses for improved efficiency and yield.

2. Notification System for Efficient Scheduling using Reinforcement Learning
- Collaborators: Carleton University
- Status: Completed in 2023
- The system monitors a cluster of Digital Twins for critical states and sends notifications to predefined recipients within a strict deadline. It addresses challenges in scalability, cost-efficiency, resource utilization, and scheduling by using a micro-service-based architecture, multi-objective optimization, and reinforcement learning for efficient scheduling.

3. AI Methods for Automated Software Testing
- Collaborator: Ericsson, Ottawa
- Status: Completed in 2020
- This initiative focused on the use of artificial intelligence to create efficient, automated testing methods for software, minimizing human intervention while improving reliability.

4. Federated Learning for Addressing Data Privacy Issues
- Collaborator: IMRSV Data Labs, Ottawa
- Status: Completed in 2020
- This project explored federated learning as a way to address data privacy challenges, allowing models to be trained across decentralized devices without the need for centralized data storage.

5. Multi-Microphone Signal Processing and Machine Learning
- Collaborator: UCIC Toronto
- Status: Completed in 2018
- The project involved processing signals from multiple microphones using machine learning to enhance sound quality and recognition, contributing to advancements in communication and audio analysis systems.
