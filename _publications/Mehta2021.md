## Abstract
The challenge in industry and academia nowadays is to classify small drones and distinguish them from the
birds at distances where technologies like radar micro-Doppler, visual, acoustic and radio-frequency sensing
systems are not able to detect. The paper presents a method for target tracking and classification of objects in
ranges greater than 500 m. We discuss the overall architecture of the system including tracking and initial
model for classification. The initial experiment and simulation show very good classification accuracy.
