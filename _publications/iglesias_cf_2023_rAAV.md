## Abstract

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is the most effective viral vector technology for directly translating the genomic revolution into medicinal therapies. However, the manufacturing of rAAV viral vectors remains challenging in the upstream processing with low rAAV yield in large-scale product â€¦
