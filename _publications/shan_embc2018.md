Ballistocardiography (BCG) is the measurement of body movement by forces associated with heart contraction that can be used for monitoring cardiac activity. It has already been measured by force sensor and accelerometer. In this research, we developed a capacitive wristband that provides a method for single point, continuous BCG measurement, which has the potential to become a new type of sensor for wearable health care. The aim of this paper is to validate that the signal detected by capacitive electrodes is actually the BCG signal. Signals from four healthy subjects were acquired by a capacitive wristband together with Electrocardiogram (ECG). The capacitive signal was validated by both morphology matching analysis and wave occurrence time matching analysis to show that it is indeed BCG signal. JJ intervals extracted from BCG were shown to have potential to be surrogate of ECG RR series in heart rate variability analysis.
