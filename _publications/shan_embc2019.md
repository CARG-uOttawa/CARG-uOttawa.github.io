Blood pressure (BP) is an important physiological marker of human health. It is commonly measured by a cuff-based monitor via either auscultatory or oscillometric methods. Recently, significant research has been conducted to mathematically estimate BP from pulse transit time (PTT) to enable cuffless and continuous BP measurement. In this research, a new time reference, RJ interval, which is the time delay between electrocardiogram (ECG) R peak and ballistocardiogram (BCG) J peak was evaluated to determine if it can be used as a surrogate of PTT in cuffless BP estimation. Biomedical signals from ten healthy subjects were acquired by BCG, ECG and PPG sensors and the continuous reference BP data were collected by a cuff-based Finometer PRO BP monitor. An exponential model was employed to estimate systolic blood pressure (SBP) using RJ interval and PTT. RJ intervals extracted from ECG and BCG were shown to be useful in evaluating trends of SBP and can be the surrogate of PTT in cuffless SBP estimation.
