Respiration rate (RR) and respiration patterns (RP) are considered early indicators of physiological conditions and cardiorespiratory diseases. In this study, we addressed the problem of contactless estimation of RR and classification of RP of one person or two persons in a confined space under realistic conditions. We used three impulse radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) radars and a 3D depth camera (Kinect) to avoid any blind spot in the room and to ensure that at least one of the radars covers the monitored subjects. This article proposes a subject localization and radar selection algorithm using a Kinect camera to allow the measurement of the respiration of multiple people placed at random locations. Several different experiments were conducted to verify the algorithms proposed in this work. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the estimated RR and reference RR of one-subject and two-subjects RR estimation are 0.61±0.53 breaths/min and 0.68±0.24 breaths/min, respectively. A respiratory pattern classification algorithm combining feature-based random forest classifier and pattern discrimination algorithm was developed to classify different respiration patterns including eupnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, Kussmaul respiration and apnea. The overall classification accuracy of 90% was achieved on a test dataset. Finally, a real-time system showing RR and RP classification on a graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented for monitoring two subjects.
