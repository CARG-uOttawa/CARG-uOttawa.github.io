## Abstract

Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring is important for the prevention and early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Cuffless BP estimation using pulse arrival time (PAT) via a mathematical model which enables continuous BP measurement has recently become a popular research topic. In this study â€¦
