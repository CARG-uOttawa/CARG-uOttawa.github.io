Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring is important for the prevention and early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Cuffless BP estimation using pulse arrival time (PAT) via a mathematical model which enables continuous BP measurement has recently become a popular research topic. In this study, simultaneous biomedical signals from ten healthy subjects were acquired by electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors and the continuous reference BP data were collected by a cuff-based Finometer PRO BP monitor. A hierarchical model was applied to estimate the parameters of a nonlinear model which in turn is used to estimate systolic blood pressure (SBP) using PAT Swith few calibration measurements. The mean absolute difference (MAD) between the estimated SBP and reference SBP is 4.35±1.43 mmHg using the proposed hierarchical model with three calibration measurements and is 4.36±1.17 mmHg with a single calibration measurement.
