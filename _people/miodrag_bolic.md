[Miodrag Bolic](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~mbolic/) runs CARG lab at the University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
Miodrag Bolic received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stony Brook University, US, in 2004. Since 2004 he has been with the University of Ottawa, Canada, where he is Professor and Associate Director of Computer Engineering program with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He is a Director of the Computational Analysis and Acceleration Research Group. His current research interests includes signal processing, machine learning and uncertainty quantification for biomedical and autonomous vehicle applications.  

For the past 15 years, Dr. Bolic has worked on cardiorespiratory monitoring, engaging in both the design of devices and the development of signal processing algorithms/machine learning models. His expertise in wearable devices extends to monitoring systems based on ECG, PPG, oscillometric and continuous blood pressure, and EMG. In his ongoing project, he leverages physiological signals to detect and classify emotions. Dr. Bolic's work in contactless monitoring includes the estimation of breathing and heart rates, as well as the classification of breathing patterns using various technologies such as radars, RGB, thermal, and 3D cameras. In 2023, he published the book "Pervasive Cardiovascular and Respiratory Monitoring Devices: Model-Based Design," with Academic Press/Elsevier.

Over the past 6 years, Dr. Bolic was involved in multiple projects related to UAV intruder detection, tracking and classification.
