### Bio

I am a ML Engineer with a robust background in software engineering. My experience spans across various projects, from molecular dynamics simulations to digital twins development. Currently, I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science (Machine Learning) at the University of Ottawa. With over 10 years of experience in ML, I bring expertise in deep learning, Bayesian modeling, federated learning, and data fusion for time series analysis, regression, classification, forecasting and clustering tasks. I excel in both independent and collaborative environments, effectively bridging technical and business domains by translating complex technical concepts into actionable insights. My strengths lie in innovative problem-solving, optimizing data pipelines and algorithms with advanced statistical techniques, and maintaining a commitment to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of emerging analytics technologies.
