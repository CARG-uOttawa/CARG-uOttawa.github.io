### Bio

Currently, Shan is a Ph.D. candidate in the Health Device Research Group (HDRG) at the University of Ottawaâ€™s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. His research is supervised by Professor Miodrag Bolic. He earned his M.Sc. degree from the University of Ottawa in 2019 and his B.Eng. degree from Northeastern University (China) in 2016.


### Research Interests

His research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, signal processing and vital sign monitoring. His main reaseach focus is cuffless blood pressure (BP) estimation using wearable devices with Electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Currently, He's deeply engaged in addressing challenges related to long-term BP trend tracking and quickly adapt a pre-trained model to new users with very limited calibrations.
